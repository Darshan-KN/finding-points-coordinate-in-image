# Finding Points Coordinates in Images

## Introduction

This project aims to detect specific points in images and extract their coordinates. By providing an image link, the program identifies and returns the coordinates of the points of interest. The project is designed to work with images where the points are clearly distinguishable, such as images with marked fiducial points or specific patterns.

## Features

- **Automatic Point Detection**: Detects points in images and extracts their coordinates.
- **Custom Coordinate Specification**: Allows users to specify points' coordinates if known.
- **Image Visualization**: Displays the image with detected points marked for verification.
- **Flexible Input**: Supports both image links and local image files.



## Usage

### Detecting Points

To detect points in an image, provide the image URL or path to the image file:

```python
from point_detection import detect_points

image_url = "https://example.com/path/to/your/image.jpg"
coordinates = detect_points(image_url)
print("Detected coordinates:", coordinates)
```

### Specifying Coordinates

If you already know the coordinates of certain points, you can specify them directly:

```python
from point_detection import plot_points

known_coordinates = [(50, 100), (150, 200), (250, 300)]
plot_points(image_url, known_coordinates)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Automatic Detection

**Input Image:**

![BMJHSET2AP_points_plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9183eb4-b7d8-4c80-a011-fe3c97327f65)

**Detected Points:**

```
[(50, 100), (150, 200), (250, 300)]
```

**Output Image:**

![BMJHSET2AP_points_plot_annotated](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f762134-819f-4010-b246-096b637f32a6)
